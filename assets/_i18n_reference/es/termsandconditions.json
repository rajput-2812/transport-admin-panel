  "educationalmaterial": "<0><0>FMCSR 382.601(B)</0> Educational Materials Addendum to Operations/Safety Guidelines Manual Dot Drug & Alcohol Testing Program for CDL Drivers</0><1>The persons designated to answer questions about the educational materials and the drug and alcohol testing policy are Steve Blake and/or Rita Bailey.</1><2>The drug and alcohol testing policy is applicable to drivers required to have a CDL.</2><3>The drug and alcohol testing policy is applicable to drivers required to have a CDL during the performance of a safety-sensitive function. Safety-sensitive function means all time from the time a driver begins to work or is required to be in readiness to work until the time he/she is relieved from work and all responsibility for performing work. Performing a safety-sensitive function means a driver is considered to be performing a safety-sensitive function during any period in which he or she is actually performing, ready to perform, or immediately available to perform any safety-sensitive functions. Safety-sensitive functions shall include: (1) All time at an employer or shipper plant, terminal, facility, or other property, or on any public property, waiting to be dispatched, unless the driver has been relieved from duty by the employer; (2) All time inspecting equipment as required by <2>392.7</2> and <4>392.8</4> of this sub-chapter or otherwise inspecting, servicing, or conditioning any commercial motor vehicle at any time; (3) All time spent at the driving controls of a commercial motor vehicle in operation; (4) All time, other than driving time, in or upon any commercial motor vehicle except time spent resting in a sleeper berth (a berth conforming to the requirements of <7>393.76</7>of this sub-chapter); (5) All time loading or unloading a vehicle, supervising, or assisting in the loading or unloading, attending a vehicle being loaded or unloaded, remaining in readiness to operate the vehicle, or in giving or receiving receipts for shipments loaded or unloaded; and, (6) All time repairing, obtaining assistance, or remaining in attendance upon a disabled vehicle. </3><4>Prohibited conduct is described in the motor carrier’s Operations/Safety Guidelines Manual, the FMCSR, and TXMCSR.</4><5>The circumstances under which a CDL driver will be tested are as follows: (1) Pre-Employment; (2) Post-Accident; (3) Random; and (4) Reasonable Suspicion. Return To Duty and Follow-Up testing may be used at the sole discretion of the motor carrier.</5><6>The testing procedures in the policy are established in <2>FMCSR Part 40 and 382.</2> The motor carrier utilizes a qualified Third-Party Administrator to manage the DOT Drug & Alcohol Testing Program. This insures that the driver and the integrity of the testing processes are protected. This procedure safeguards the validity of test results, ensures that those results are attributed to the correct driver, and causes post-accident testing to be performed as set out in <4>382.303(d)</4>.</6><7>A driver required to have a CDL must submit to the prescribed drug and/or alcohol test(s).</7><8>Refuse to submit (to an alcohol or controlled substances test) means that a driver: (1) Fail to appear for any test (except a pre-employment test) within a reasonable time, as determined by the employer, consistent with applicable DOT agency regulations, after being directed to do so by the employer. This includes the failure of an employee (including an owner-operator) to appear for a test when called by a C/TPA (see §<1>40.61(a)</1> of this title); (2) Fail to remain at the testing site until the testing process is complete. Provided, that an employee who leaves the testing site before the testing process commences (see §<3>40.63(c)</3> of this title) a pre-employment test is not deemed to have refused to test; (3) Fail to provide a urine specimen for any drug test required by this part or DOT agency regulations. Provided, that an employee who does not provide a urine specimen because he or she has left the testing site before the testing process commences (see §<5>40.63(c)</5> of this title) for a pre-employment test is not deemed to have refused to test; (4) In the case of a directly observed or monitored collection in a drug test, fails to permit the observation or monitoring of the driver’s provision of a specimen (see §§<7>40.67(l)</7> and <10>40.69(g)</10> of this title); (5) Fail to provide a sufficient amount of urine when directed, and it has been determined, through a required medical evaluation, that there was no adequate medical explanation for the failure (see §<12>40.193(d)(2)</12> of this title); (6) Fail or declines to take a second test the employer or collector has directed the driver to take; (7) Fail to undergo a medical examination or evaluation, as directed by the MRO as part of the verification process, or as directed by the DER under §<15>40.193(d)</15> of this title. In the case of a pre-employment drug test, the employee is deemed to have refused to test on this basis only if the pre-employment test is conducted following a contingent offer of employment; (8) Fail to cooperate with any part of the testing process (e.g., refuse to empty pockets when so directed by the collector, behave in a confrontational way that disrupts the collection process); or, (9) Is reported by the MRO as having a verified adulterated or substituted test result.</8><9> A violation of the drug & alcohol testing policy of this company, the FMCSR, or TXMCSR, contains consequences for the driver required to hold a CDL. The company is a “Zero Tolerance” company; therefore, if there is a violation of a drug or alcohol testing program policy or regulation, the CDL driver shall be immediately removed from the safety-sensitive function, and the qualified driver status withdrawn. A CDL driver violating this policy or regulation shall receive a referral to a Substance Abuse Professional (SAP). The motor carrier will not be responsible for providing payment for SAP treatment.</9><10> CDL drivers found to have an alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater, but less than 0.04, will be immediately removed from the safety-sensitive function, and the qualified driver status withdrawn because it is a violation of the “Zero Tolerance” policy.</10><11>ALCOHOL</11><12>In our society, alcohol is not considered “illegal”. In most jurisdictions, a person may legally purchase, possess, and consume alcohol. Even though there are legal restrictions that vary by jurisdiction, alcohol is considered to be socially and legally acceptable. But, alcohol can be abused and the greater the level of abuse determines the level of effects on the body.</12><13>Alcohol abuse may contribute to health issues such as problems in liver function. In some cases, other parts of the body may be damaged, such as the heart or esophagus.</13><14>Alcohol abuse can be costly. The negative impact of alcohol abuse may include increased insurance premiums, healthcare costs, lost wages, and the expense of the product itself.</14><15>Symptoms may include such things as loss of motor skills, odor of alcohol, personality variation, speech problems, eye appearance, vision acuity, and general appearance. Usually, hearing vision, balance, reactions, and many other physical functions are diminished. These symptoms describe impairment and/or intoxication.</15><16>DRUGS: PRESCRIPTION DRUG ABUSE AND ILLICIT DRUG USE</16><17>Prescription drugs and over-the-counter medications may interfere with a person’s ability to safely operate a vehicle. Dependency on some drugs may occur and can be severe. All of these must be taken according to instructions by the physician or by the labels on the product container.</17><18>Illicit drugs may include such things as Marijuana, PCP, Opiates, Amphetamines and Methamphetamines. Each of these alters a person’s mental ability or personality. The effects of illicit drugs are intended to change the way a person feels and can be very intoxicating. A prescription drug used without a legal prescription becomes illicit drug use. Symptoms of this activity are described in many variations. Physical appearances may be seen in the redness of the eyes, difficulty in speaking, sleepiness/drowsiness. Other symptoms may be the opposite for other types of drug use.</18><19>An example would be evidence of nervousness, rapid heart rate, irritability, paranoia, and anger may be present. Eye pupil size can be affected, the pupil becoming enlarged or distinctively small. These symptoms describe impairment and/or intoxication.</19><20>The results of this behavior can also be financially costly and cause serious health problems.</20>",
